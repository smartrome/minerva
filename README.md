## Welcome to our project page SMART-ROME! We are still building it!

An interactive Android-based solution
for enriching the cultural experience in the Eternal City.

Objectives:
  - Development of an application which takes the camera mirror
    image, and retrieves from the cloud interactive information about the
    place it's aiming.
  - Use of Android as the chosen platform. 
  - We intend to support us with GPS (to reduce the range of search). It will
    enrich the features that can be provided to the user (suggestions of other
    places in the nearby).
